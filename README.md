# Hamri

Welcome to the Hamri programming language code base.
Hamri is initially written in Python for ease of readability by contributors
We are however transpiling the code base to c/c++ soon. 


To run the code:

1. Clone the repository to your computer

        git clone https://github.com/Hamri-language/Hamri.git

2. Add an empty file. Name it whatever you wish but make sure to give it the extension ' .ham ' . Paste the sample code into the file and save it.



        
        kwanza
        
            hamri_v = "Hamri v1.02"

            eleza sayHi(name)

                chapa "Hello world. " + "I am " + name

            kwisha


            sayHi(hamri_v)

            chapa 10 / 2

            aina(hamri_v)
        
        kwisha




Add the file's path to the 'path_' variable in the 'main.py' file

        path_ = 'path/to/your/file.ham'

4. Run the script as you would do any other python program from console

        $ python main.py

5. You can also run Hamri from the provided simple IDE.
        
        $ python Notepad.py

Note: 
    You can also run these scripts from your favourite code editor. 

The code is properly commented and annotated . Happy coding !!!
